# Larry Williams VixFix Indicator

[Larry Williams VixFix Indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/script/TXPkMxfZ-Larry-Williams-VixFix/) is a TradingView Pine Script indicator based on Larry Williams' VixFix methodology that identifies potential market bottoms (buy signals) and tops (sell signals) through multi-timeframe volatility analysis approach with statistics tracking and customisable parameters. Important to note that this indicator reprints, therefore actions should be taken after bar close instead of during.

## üìã Overview

The [Larry Williams VixFix](https://www.ireallytrade.com/newsletters/VIXFix.pdf) indicator measures price deviations from recent highs and lows over multiple timeframes to identify potential reversal points, especially for broad market index like SPY. Used in conjunction with VIX reading and the super trend indicator, can quite accurately pin the market bottoms (does not apply for market top).

## üìä Signal Interpretation & Recommended Actions

### Signal Types
The indicator generates two types of signals with intensity-based visual feedback:

**üü¢ Buy Signals** (Green background): Potential market bottom conditions
- Light Green: Single timeframe signal
- Medium Green: Two timeframes aligned
- Dark Green: All three timeframes aligned (strongest)

**üî¥ Sell Signals** (Red background): Potential market top conditions
- Light Red: Single timeframe signal
- Medium Red: Two timeframes aligned
- Dark Red: All three timeframes aligned (strongest)

### How Signals Work
- **Buy Signals**: Generated when price deviates significantly below recent lows
- **Sell Signals**: Generated when price deviates significantly above recent highs
- **Signal Strength**: Determined by number of timeframes confirming the signal
- **Priority**: Longer timeframes override shorter ones to prevent conflicts

### Trading Recommendations

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: The following are educational examples only. Always implement proper risk management with stop losses and take profits. See [DISCLAIMER.md](../DISCLAIMER.md) for full legal disclaimers. The author is not liable for any trading decisions or outcomes.

#### üü¢ Buy Signal Activation
**Recommended Action**: Consider long positions or buying call options
- **Logic**: Market may be oversold and due for a bounce. Utilize VIX reading to identify where the market is at (dangerous ‚â• 40), and super trend to gauge price reversal. Best case scenario is when Buy signals green, VIX reading > 40, super trend is red with new low.
- **Risk Management**: Depending on instrument, 10% for stocks, more for options and other leveraged instruments.
- **Take Profit**: Optional, can ride the wave until a reversal in super trend

#### üî¥ Sell Signal Activation
**Recommended Action**: I would personally recommend not to take action with the sell signal
- **Logic**: Markets naturally drift upwards, resulting in more new high then new lows, hence signalling a sell signal, meaning the signal is technically correct, but fundamentally inaccurate as there may be no reason for price to reverse.
- **Risk Management**: If a trade must be made, do cross reference with economic indicators and underlying fundamentals to justify the potential reversal
- **Take Profit**: NIL

#### üåà Multiple Timeframe Signals
**Recommended Action**: Increase position size with stronger conviction after checking VIX levels
- **Logic**: Higher probability when multiple timeframes align
- **Risk Management**: Use tighter stops with larger positions
- **Alternative**: Consider spread strategies to limit risk

### Risk Management Guidelines
- **Stop Losses**: Always use stops at logical levels
- **Position Sizing**: Never risk more than 1-2% of account per trade
- **Take Profits**: Set realistic targets based on historical performance
- **Time Limits**: Don't hold positions indefinitely without reassessment
- **Signal Quality**: Prioritize stronger multi-timeframe confirmations

### Trading Warnings
- **Not Financial Advice**: These are educational examples only
- **Individual Responsibility**: All trading decisions are your own
