## Larry Williams VixFix Indicator

The [Larry Williams VixFix](https://www.ireallytrade.com/newsletters/VIXFix.pdf) is a volatility-based indicator designed to identify potential market bottoms (buy signals) and tops (sell signals) by measuring price deviations from recent highs and lows over multiple timeframes.

### How to Use:
- Buy Signals: When the green background appears, it suggests the market may be forming a bottom. The intensity of the green shade increases as more buy conditions are met.
- Sell Signals: When the red background appears, it suggests the market may be forming a top. The intensity of the red shade increases as more sell conditions are met.
- The indicator plots three buy and three sell lines, each representing different lookback periods (1, 3, and 6 months by default). More opaque lines indicate stronger signals.

### Features:
- Multi-timeframe analysis with customizable lookback periods.
- Visual signal strength via background colour intensity.
- Transparent, layered signal lines for easy comparison.
- All values rounded to 2 decimal places for clarity.

### Interpretation:
A stronger (deeper) green or red background suggests a higher probability of a reversal in that direction.
Use in conjunction with fundamental and economic analysis for best results.
