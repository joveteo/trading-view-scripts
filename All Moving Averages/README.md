Each moving average type offers unique characteristics in terms of lag, smoothness, and responsiveness, allowing traders to identify the most effective tool for their specific market conditions and trading strategies.

## 📊 Supported Moving Averages

| Abbreviation | Full Name | Characteristics |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **SMA** | Simple Moving Average | Basic average of prices over specified period |
| **EMA** | Exponential Moving Average | More responsive to recent price changes |
| **WMA** | Weighted Moving Average | Recent prices have higher weight |
| **HMA** | Hull Moving Average | Reduces lag while maintaining smoothness |
| **VWMA** | Volume Weighted Moving Average | Incorporates volume in calculation |
| **RMA** | Relative Moving Average (Wilder's) | Used in RSI and other indicators |
| **DEMA** | Double Exponential Moving Average | Two EMAs for reduced lag |
| **TEMA** | Triple Exponential Moving Average | Three EMAs for minimal lag |
| **KAMA** | Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average | Adapts to market volatility |
| **ALMA** | Arnaud Legoux Moving Average | Offset-based for reduced noise |
| **LSMA** | Least Squares Moving Average | Linear regression line |
| **TMA** | Triangular Moving Average | Double-smoothed for stability |
| **ZLEMA** | Zero Lag Exponential Moving Average | Eliminates inherent lag |
